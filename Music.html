  <!--Description about concerts from a musician's perspective-->
    <h3> Concerts </h3>
    <p> The most widely anticipated event of any musician; concerts. These are stress filled nightmares, where one must sit in an uncomfortable chair, among their fellow classmates, as they're criticized by a mass of people who can't even play an instrument. Though the band is usually excited for the chance to showcase their hard work in the weeks leading up to the event, when the day actually arrives, the group would rather bury their heads in the sand. </p>

  <!--Where the term "band family" is from-->
    <p> This is a term I learned from my younger sister, to describe the bond the band develops over the year. In my sister's case, this is usually developed early in the year with a game involving a ball of yarn. Though the term is meant to be endearing, it sounds more sarcastic than anything else. But maybe that's just me... </p>
